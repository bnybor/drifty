/*
 * dv_metrics - Monte-Carlo measurement of decoding-mistake rate as a function
 * of the channel's flip / insert / delete / erase rates, for each standard code.
 *
 * For one data point we: generate a random message, encode it (with a flush so
 * the message bits sit in the stream interior), pass the coded bits through a
 * channel that independently flips, inserts, deletes, and erases (marks lost)
 * bits, stream-decode, and count how many decoded bits disagree with the
 * original message.
 *
 * The reported metric is the normalized EDIT (Levenshtein) distance between the
 * decoded bits and the original message, divided by the number of message bits.
 * Edit distance counts the substitutions, insertions, and deletions needed to
 * turn one into the other, so a single uncorrected sync slip costs one edit
 * rather than misaligning (and thus mis-scoring) the whole remaining stream -
 * the right metric when the channel itself inserts and deletes bits. A first
 * `warmup` bits are dropped from both sequences to skip the decoder's
 * blind-acquisition transient, and the trailing flush bits are trimmed off.
 *
 * Each axis (flip, insert, delete) is swept independently with the other two
 * rates held at zero, so each curve isolates one channel impairment.
 *
 * Alongside the edit rate we report two confidence metrics, both in [0, 1]:
 *
 *   mean_lock   - the decoder's own running estimate (see dv_stream_decode's
 *                 lock_probability) that it is tracking a valid coded stream,
 *                 averaged across the kept bits. It shows how confidently the
 *                 decoder stays synced as each impairment ramps up.
 *   mean_detect - the blind detector's confidence (dv_detect) that the stream
 *                 carries *any* rate-1/n, constraint-length-k code, with no
 *                 knowledge of the generators or the sent bits, averaged over a
 *                 sliding window across the received bits. It shows how
 *                 recognizable the coded structure stays as the channel ramps.
 *
 * Output is CSV on stdout (see header row); feed it to metrics/plot_metrics.py.
 *
 * Usage: dv_metrics [trials] [info_bits] [seed]
