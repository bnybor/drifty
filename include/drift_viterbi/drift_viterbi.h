 * Umbrella header for the full drift_viterbi API. The library is split into the
 * sender's half (encode.h - pick a code and encode), the receiver's half
 * (decode.h - stream-decode received bits), and a blind code comparison
 * (compare.h - do two streams share a code?). Include this to get all of them
 * at once, or include just the part you need.
