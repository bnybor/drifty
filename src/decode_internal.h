 * Private decoder internals shared by the single-stream decoder (decode.c) and
 * the multi-decoder (multi.c). Not installed.
 *
 * The sliding-window Viterbi state splits in two: a `dv_decode_ctx` holds
 * everything identical across codes decoded over the same stream - the received
 * buffer, the cadence (read_base/steps/decided and the shared re-anchor history),
 * the channel-derived cost constants, and the trellis dimensions - while a
 * `dv_trellis` holds one code's per-step working state. The single decoder is one
 * ctx + one trellis; the multi-decoder is one ctx + an array of trellises stepped
 * in lockstep, so a single received buffer and a single re-anchor decision serve
 * them all.
